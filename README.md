# Beer Profiler

Web address: https://11lugg.github.io/beer-profile/

This beer profiler allows you to find a beer best suited to the type of food you will be eating alongside.

I am making a get request to https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 and I am running the request with new parameters based on which button is clicked in the navbar.

It is built using functional react components, bootstrap and webhooks (useEffect and useState)
